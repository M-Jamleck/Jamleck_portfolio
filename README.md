# [Project 1: Grosery Sales Project](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/169XA57jr7EunMH07HkBardhyfOHACvEa?usp=drive_link)

This project analyzes grocery sales data to uncover key insights about revenue, customer behavior, and product performance. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and seven datasets the grosery sales have, we explore: 

Sales Trends ‚Äì Here, I analyzed how revenue changes monthly.

Customer Insights ‚Äì I identified high-value customers based on their total spending.

Product Performance ‚Äì I examined top-selling products and those with consistently low sales.

Employee Performance ‚Äì I assessed how an employee‚Äôs tenure correlates with their sales performance.

# [Project 2: Winequality-Red Project](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17v9rZSO2_l5dlGNqKBk3pYY_GOlFedMN?usp=sharing)

This was part of a personal project where i delve into the characteristics of red wine to understand what influences its quality. Using python visualization techniques, i explore how factors like acidity, sugar levels, alcohol content, and pH correlate with overall wine ratings.
This analysis helps identify the key attributes that contribute to a high-quality wine. You can access this project [Here.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17v9rZSO2_l5dlGNqKBk3pYY_GOlFedMN?usp=drive_link)


# [Project 3: Malaria Infection Project](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Vqgk1jnOaP13IuOIr_xahUhKRZn86_gL?usp=sharing)

In this analysis, I applied a log transformation to the number of malaria cases to handle skewness and improve interpretability helping in stabilizing variance and make patterns in the data more apparent.

Pearson's correlation test was conducted, which measures the strength and direction of associations between numerical features, helping identify key factors influencing malaria infection rates.
