## Tableau Dashboards:

# [Dashboard 1: Employee Attrition](https://public.tableau.com/views/EmployeeAttritionDashboard_17406360512570/employeeattritiondashboard?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no)
Explored what drives employees to stay or leave, uncovering trends that impact retention. By looking at tenure, job roles, promotions, and workload, I identified key factors influencing turnover. This analysis helps organizations create better work environments, improve employee satisfaction, and reduce unnecessary attrition.

# [Dashboard 2: Seattle Weather Prediction](https://public.tableau.com/views/SeattleweatherPrediction/SeattleWeatherPredictionDashboard?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no)
Here, I explored historical weather patterns to uncover trends in temperature, precipitation, and wind conditions. By analyzing year-over-year changes, seasonal shifts, and different weather conditions, this dashboard helps in understanding climate patterns and making informed weather predictions.

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Python Projects:</h2>

# [Project 1: Grocery Sales](https://github.com/M-Jamleck/Jamleck_portfolio/blob/f2747c6c16f56826ed9e3daa4338bc5445665f12/Glosery%20sales%20Project.ipynb)

This project analyzes grocery sales data to uncover key insights about revenue, customer behavior, and product performance. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and seven datasets the grosery sales have, we explore: 

Sales Trends ‚Äì Here, I analyzed how revenue changes monthly.

Customer Insights ‚Äì I identified high-value customers based on their total spending.

Product Performance ‚Äì I examined top-selling products and those with consistently low sales.

Employee Performance ‚Äì I assessed how an employee‚Äôs tenure correlates with their sales performance.

# [Project 2: Winequality-Red](https://github.com/M-Jamleck/Jamleck_portfolio/blob/194a1d4619c29febc85a8cc88724de369d3cb780/winequality-red%20project.ipynb)

This was part of a personal project where i delve into the characteristics of red wine to understand what influences its quality. Using python visualization techniques, i explore how factors like acidity, sugar levels, alcohol content, and pH correlate with overall wine ratings.
This analysis helps identify the key attributes that contribute to a high-quality wine. [view]( https://github.com/M-Jamleck/Jamleck_portfolio/blob/194a1d4619c29febc85a8cc88724de369d3cb780/winequality-red%20project.ipynb)


# [Project 3: Malaria Infection]( https://github.com/M-Jamleck/Jamleck_portfolio/blob/194a1d4619c29febc85a8cc88724de369d3cb780/malaria%20Infection%20project.ipynb)

In this analysis, I applied a log transformation to the number of malaria cases to handle skewness and improve interpretability helping in stabilizing variance and make patterns in the data more apparent.

Pearson's correlation test was conducted, which measures the strength and direction of associations between numerical features, helping identify key factors influencing malaria infection rates.
